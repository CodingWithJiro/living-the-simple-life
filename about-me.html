                    My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
                </h2>

                <div class="about-me-content">
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">I used to be a pack rat</span>. I had so many things that I thought that I
                        loved, but the truth was I
                        couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I
                        couldn't hold a relationship.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        How I turned things around
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</span>. I
                        literally put 90% of my
                        possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else
                        to
                        do. And it worked.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Now I live the simple life
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much
                        better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With how
                        much it turned my life around, <span class="bold">I felt like I had no choice but to start
                            sharing how I did it</span>,
                        and
                        how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
