This is a simple personal blog layout built with HTML5 and CSS3. It contains three fully responsive pages that highlight personal information and blog-style entries using semantic structure, responsive design, and basic accessibility.

---

## Overview

This project is a continuation of my frontend learning path, where I practiced creating multiple HTML pages styled consistently with a single CSS file. It emphasizes layout structure using CSS Grid and mobile-first responsive techniques. The design follows clean and modern web standards with accessible HTML elements and ARIA support.

Each page shares a consistent header and footer, with main content blocks that vary based on the page's purpose. The project was built from scratch and helped me understand multi-page architecture.

## Features

- Responsive multi-page layout (`index`, `about-me`, and `recent-posts`)
- Semantic HTML5 structure with `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- CSS Grid layout with `grid-template-areas`
- Fluid typography using `clamp()`
- Mobile-first design with breakpoints for larger screens
- Navigation bar shared across all pages
- Simple card-based design for blog entries
- ARIA roles for accessibility
