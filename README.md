## ℹ️ A Multi-Page Responsive Blog Layout with Semantic HTML and CSS Grid

<div style="display: flex, align-items: center, justify-content: center, flex-flow: row wrap">
    <img src="./screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot of the project page." width="300">
    <img src="./screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot of the project page." width="300">
    <img src="./screenshot3.png" alt="Screenshot of the project page." width="300">
</div>

This is a simple personal blog layout built with HTML5 and CSS3. It contains three fully responsive pages that highlight personal information and blog-style entries using semantic structure, responsive design, and basic accessibility.

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a continuation of my frontend learning path, where I practiced creating multiple HTML pages styled consistently with a single CSS file. It emphasizes layout structure using CSS Grid and mobile-first responsive techniques. The design follows clean and modern web standards with accessible HTML elements and ARIA support.

Each page shares a consistent header and footer, with main content blocks that vary based on the page's purpose. The project was built from scratch and helped me understand multi-page architecture.
